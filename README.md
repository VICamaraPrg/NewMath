# NewMath
<h3>Welcome to NewMath class v1.0!</h3>
<p>In this repository we're going to implement new static methods and classes (All in one repo) that native java Math doesn't implements, and hopefully be useful to you!
<p>The idea is to have a new Roadmap or Work In Progress for each new version released, adding more and more methods to each version.
Of course minor versions will be released and the objective are the correction of bugs, and little optimizations that can make the methods even faster, giving a nice performance while using it on your programs.<br/>
<p>Also, new ideas are welcome to implement, as well as if you see a coding error or do you think a method can be optimized, please feel free to open a new issue.
  
  <h2>Dependencies</h2>
  From now on, JUnit5 is a mandatory dependency just if you want to use the testing environment! https://github.com/junit-team/junit5
  
  <h3>You will find all info about releases, methods explaination and contributors in the wiki!</h3>
  <h1>Â¿How to use NewMath?</h1>
  
  The easiest way to do it is just download the release located at releases sidebar Or just download the source code). Then import it on your project. That's it, you're ready to use it!
