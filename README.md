# NewMath
<h3>Welcome to NewMath class v1.0!</h3>
<p>In this repository we're going to implement new static methods (All in one repo) that native java Math doesn't implements, and hopefully be useful to you!
<p>The idea is to have a new Roadmap or Work In Progress for each new version released, adding more and more methods to each version.
Of course minor versions will be released and the objective are the correction of bugs, and little optimizations that can make the methods even faster, giving a nice performance while using it on your programs.<br/>
<p>Also, new ideas are welcome to implement, as well as if you see a coding error or do you think a method can be optimized, please feel free to open a new issue.
  
  <h4>You will find all info about releases, methods explaination and contributors in the wiki!</h4>
  <h2>Â¿How to use NewMath?</h2>
  The easiest way to do it is just download the src/newmath or copy the content of file inside of it (NewMath.java), as you wish. Then import it on your project as a java class. That's it, you're ready to use it! Call a method of the class by typing "NewMath." And then all methods available will appear!
